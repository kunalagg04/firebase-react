/* Reactâ€™s Context API to provide a Firebase instance once at the top-level of your component hierarchy.
The createContext() function essentially creates two components. 
The FirebaseContext.Provider component is used to provide a Firebase instance once at the top-level of your React component tree, which we will do in this section;
 and the FirebaseContext.Consumer component is used to retrieve the Firebase instance if it is needed in the React component */
